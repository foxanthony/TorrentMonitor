The application watches changes on the popular torrent trackers and automatically updates downloads (series, reuploaded torrent files, etc) on your favorite client.

###Supported trackers:

###Prerequisites:

* Web-server (Apache, nginx, lighttpd)
* PHP (5.2 or above) with cURL and PDO
* MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite
* Yii framework 1.1.13 (optional, can be cloned with TorrentMonitor)

###Installing:

You may choose the standalone Yii installation or embedded.

###Using standalone Yii instalation

Clone TorrentMonitor into temporary folder (for example: /tmp/TorrentMonitor)

```
# git clone https://github.com/foxanthony/TorrentMonitor.git /tmp/TorrentMonitor

```

Go to the /tmp/TorrentMonitor/TorrentMonitor.

```
# cd /tmp/TorrentMonitor/TorrentMonitor
```

Open index.php file with your favorite text editor and set valid path where Yii was installed.
Save the file.

Copy all files into your server www folder.

```
# cp * /path/to/www -R
```

Remove all /tmp/TorrentMonitor files. Be careful! Double check the command you are going to run.

```
# rm -rf /tmp/TorrentMonitor
```

Change directories owner to www-server user.

```
# chown http:http /path/to/www -R
```

Make sure that /path/to/yii onwer is www-server user. And if it doesn't use the following command to 
change it.

```
# chown http:http /path/to/yii -R
```

###Using embedded Yii installation

Clone TorrentMonitor into temporary folder (for example: /tmp/TorrentMonitor).

```
# git clone --recursive https://github.com/foxanthony/TorrentMonitor.git /tmp/TorrentMonitor
```

Go to the /tmp/TorrentMonitor/TorrentMonitor.

```
# cd /tmp/TorrentMonitor/TorrentMonitor
```

Copy all TorrentMonitor files into /path/to/www.

```
# cp * /path/to/www -R
```

Go to the /tmp/TorrentMonitor/yii.

```
# cd ../yii
```

Copy Yii files into /path/to/yii.

```
# cp * /path/to/yii -R
```

Make sure that yii and www folders are in the same directory.

Remove all /tmp/TorrentMonitor files. Be careful! Double check the command you are going to run.

```
# rm -rf /tmp/TorrentMonitor
```

Change directories owner to www-server user.

```
# chown http:http /path/to/yii -R
# chown http:http /path/to/www -R
```

###Configuration:

Go to the TorrentMonitor folder (where index.php is located).

```
# cd /path/to/www
```

Copy config.php.example file into config.php.

```
# cp protected/config/config.php.example protected/config/config.php
```

Open config.php with you favorite text editor. Fill language, torrent trackers credentials, client parameters.
Choose database type and its connection options. If you don't want to use some trackers you should comment them.
Set up your config and save.

###Database initialization

Just run the following command:

```
/path/to/protected/yiic migrate up
```

###Configurate schedule

Add into cron the following string:

```
* * * * *	/path/to/www/protected/yiic cron run
```

###PHP settings:

You need to change the following parameters in php.ini (in CLI as well as in www-server):

```
; Increase maximum execution time of each script, in seconds
max_execution_time = 300

; Define the default timezone (use your own parameters)
date.timezone = Europe/Moscow

; Allow the treatment of URLs (like http:// or ftp://) as files
allow_url_fopen = on

; Allow open directories (use your own parameters)
open_basedir = /tmp/:/path/to/www:/path/to/yii
```

Install PHP modules using your packet manager: CURL, MySQL client, PDO-MySQL, Sqlite client, PDO-Sqlite, PostgreSQL client, PDO-PostgreSQL.
You need to install just one database client which you really want to use with TorrentMonitor.

Do not forget enable modules you need (consult distib documentation).

###Updating:

Backup your config.php. Remove all files related to TorrentMonitor (you can keep Yii framework files if you want).
Instead of copying config.php.example into config.php, restore config.php, consult config.php.example for new features, change
config.php file according to sample. Do not forget about database migration.

```
/path/to/protected/yiic migrate up
```
